# hastebin
simple and dependecy-less hastebin cli

this will take stdin and upload it to the server set with the HASTEBIN_SERVER_URL environment variable. (defaults to the official hastebin instance)

it was heavily inspired by [this script I cant find online anymore](https://paste.nils.lol/zeguyedegu) and the need to not depend on python and python-requests.
